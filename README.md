# ns-win
Windows API wrapper written in C, allowing for easy and efficient usage of windows' API in your program - Making windows, controls and anything an everything in between. Work in progress for now, but usable and is used in my projects.


At some point, I will update this read-me, as I finish making this a proect of its' own, rather than being something I add to all
my own projects. It has grown too far to be an 'addon' by itself, and is now a library all of its own.
